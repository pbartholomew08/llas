* Introduction

=LLAS= is an implementation of =BLAS= in Common Lisp.

* Building

=LLAS= uses the =asdf= system definition facility for building and loading.
The structure of the system and how it should be built is described the file =llas.asd= shown in
listing\nbsp[[src:llas.asd]]. 
To build and/or load =LLAS= ensure the source is in the path searched by =asdf= and evaluate
~(asdf:load-system :llas)~.
